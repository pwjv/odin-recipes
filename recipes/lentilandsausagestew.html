        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 lb. Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion</li>
            <li>3 carrots</li>
            <li>4 ribs celery</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2 cups brown lentils</li>
            <li>6 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cayenne</li>
            <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>10 oz. frozen spinach</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Brown the sausage in a large pot over medium heat, breaking it up into pieces as it cooks.</li>
            <li>While the sausage is cooking, prepare your vegetables: wash, peel and slice the carrots, slice the celery, dice the onion, and mince the garlic. Once the sausage is cooked, add the vegetables to the pot and continue to saut√© until the onions are soft and transparent (about 5 min).</li>
            <li>Add the lentils to the pot along with the cayenne, cumin, smoked paprika, oregano, and chicken broth.</li>
            <li>Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to medium-high, and allow it to come up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and let simmer for 30 minutes or until the lentils are tender. Add more water if it gets too dry.</li>
            <li>Stir in the frozen spinach and cook for about 15 minutes more. Serve with a thick slice of crusty bread!</li>
        </ol>
